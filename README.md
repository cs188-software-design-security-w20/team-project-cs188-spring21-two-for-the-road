## Team : Two-For-The-Road
# Description:
Our software is a web application catered for UCLA students and club recruiters that enables both parties to job match. 
In our application, students can find jobs that suit them based on their abilities, 
while club recruiters can find employees that match their job description. From our personal experiences, 
students do not get easy access to the job postings connected to different UCLA clubs because there is not a cohesive place to find them. This is unlike the real world, 
where finding job postings is comparatively simple with websites and applications like monster.com and LinkedIn.
